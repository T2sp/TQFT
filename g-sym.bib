  abstract = {A q-form global symmetry is a global symmetry for which the charged operators are of space-time dimension q; e.g. Wilson lines, surface defects, etc., and the charged excitations have q spatial dimensions; e.g. strings, membranes, etc. Many of the properties of ordinary global symmetries (q = 0) apply here. They lead to Ward identities and hence to selection rules on amplitudes. Such global symmetries can be coupled to classical background fields and they can be gauged by summing over these classical fields. These generalized global symmetries can be spontaneously broken (either completely or to a subgroup). They can also have 't Hooft anomalies, which prevent us from gauging them, but lead to 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. Such anomalies can also lead to anomaly inflow on various defects and exotic Symmetry Protected Topological phases. Our analysis of these symmetries gives a new unified perspective of many known phenomena and uncovers new results.},

  abstract = {We consider coupling an ordinary quantum field theory with an infinite number of degrees of freedom to a topological field theory. On R\^{}d the new theory differs from the original one by the spectrum of operators. Sometimes the local operators are the same but there are different line operators, surface operators, etc. The effects of the added topological degrees of freedom are more dramatic when we compactify R\^{}d, and they are crucial in the context of electric-magnetic duality. We explore several examples including Dijkgraaf-Witten theories and their generalizations both in the continuum and on the lattice. When we couple them to ordinary quantum field theories the topological degrees of freedom allow us to express certain characteristic classes of gauge fields as integrals of local densities, thus simplifying the analysis of their physical consequences.},

  abstract = {We study various aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking in theories that possess higher-form symmetries, which are symmetries whose charged objects have a dimension p {$>$} 0. We first sketch a proof of a higher version of Goldstone's theorem, and then discuss how boundary conditions and gauge-fixing issues are dealt with in theories with spontaneously broken higher symmetries, focusing in particular on p-form U (1) gauge theories. We then elaborate on a generalization of the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem for higher-form symmetries, namely that in spacetime dimension D, continuous p-form symmetries can never be spontaneously broken if p {$\geq$} D - 2. We also make a few comments on relations between higher symmetries and asymptotic symmetries in Abelian gauge theory.},

  abstract = {The low-energy physics of systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking is governed by the associated Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons. While NG bosons in Lorentz-invariant systems are well understood, the precise characterization of their number and dispersion relations in a general quantum many-body system is still an open problem. An inequality relating the number of NG bosons and their dispersion relations to the number of broken symmetry generators was found by Nielsen and Chadha. In this paper, we give a presumably first example of a system in which the Nielsen-Chadha inequality is actually not saturated. We suggest that the number of NG bosons is exactly equal to the number of broken generators minus the number of pairs of broken generators whose commutator has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. This naturally leads us to a proposal for a different classification of NG bosons.},

We show how to count their number and study their dispersion relations. Their number is less than the number of broken generators when some of them form canonically conjugate pairs. The pairing occurs when the generators have a nonzero expectation value of their commutator. For non-semi-simple algebras, central extensions are possible. The underlying geometry of the coset space in general is partially symplectic.},
