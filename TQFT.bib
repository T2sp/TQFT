  abstract = {We construct topological defects in two-dimensional classical lattice models and quantum chains. The defects satisfy local commutation relations guaranteeing that the partition function is independent of their path. These relations and their solutions are extended to allow defect lines to fuse, branch and satisfy all the properties of a fusion category. We show how the two-dimensional classical lattice models and their topological defects are naturally described by boundary conditions of a Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury partition function. These defects allow Kramers-Wannier duality to be generalized to a large class of models, explaining exact degeneracies between non-symmetry-related ground states as well as in the low-energy spectrum. They give a precise and general notion of twisted boundary conditions and the universal behavior under Dehn twists. Gluing a topological defect to a boundary yields linear identities between partition functions with different boundary conditions, allowing ratios of the universal g-factor to be computed exactly on the lattice. We develop this construction in detail in a variety of examples, including the Potts, parafermion and height models.},

  abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a `cobordism': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and `quantum topology'. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of `closed symmetric monoidal category'. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that if we gauge a Zn symmetry in two dimensions, a dual Zn symmetry appears, such that re-gauging this dual Zn symmetry leads back to the original theory. We describe how this can be generalized to non-Abelian groups, by enlarging the concept of symmetries from those defined by groups to those defined by unitary fusion categories. We will see that this generalization is also useful when studying what happens when a non-anomalous subgroup of an anomalous finite group is gauged: for example, the gauged theory can have non-Abelian group symmetry even when the original symmetry is an Abelian group. We then discuss the axiomatization of two-dimensional topological quantum field theories whose symmetry is given by a category. We see explicitly that the gauged version is a topological quantum field theory with a new symmetry given by a dual category.},

Generalizing and encompassing both global symmetries and Verlinde lines, TDLs together with their attached defect operators provide models of fusion categories without braiding. We study the crossing relations of TDLs, discuss their relation to the 't Hooft anomaly, and use them to constrain renormalization group flows to either conformal critical points or topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). We show that if certain non-invertible TDLs are preserved along a RG flow, then the vacuum cannot be a non-degenerate gapped state. For various massive flows, we determine the infrared TQFTs completely from the consideration of TDLs together with modular invariance.},

They lead to Ward identities and hence to selection rules on amplitudes. Such global symmetries can be coupled to classical background fields and they can be gauged by summing over these classical fields. These generalized global symmetries can be spontaneously broken (either completely or to a subgroup). They can also have 't Hooft anomalies, which prevent us from gauging them, but lead to 't Hooft anomaly matching conditions. Such anomalies can also lead to anomaly inflow on various defects and exotic Symmetry Protected Topological phases. Our analysis of these symmetries gives a new unified perspective of many known phenomena and uncovers new results.},

In this work, we explore the SymTFT for theories with Kramers-Wannier-like duality symmetry in both \$(1+1)\$d and \$(3+1)\$d quantum field theories.

We explore several examples including Dijkgraaf-Witten theories and their generalizations both in the continuum and on the lattice.

While NG bosons in Lorentz-invariant systems are well understood, the precise characterization of their number and dispersion relations in a general quantum many-body system is still an open problem. An inequality relating the number of NG bosons and their dispersion relations to the number of broken symmetry generators was found by Nielsen and Chadha. In this paper, we give a presumably first example of a system in which the Nielsen-Chadha inequality is actually not saturated. We suggest that the number of NG bosons is exactly equal to the number of broken generators minus the number of pairs of broken generators whose commutator has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. This naturally leads us to a proposal for a different classification of NG bosons.},
